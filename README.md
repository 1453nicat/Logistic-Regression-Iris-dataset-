# Logistic-Regression-Iris-dataset-

# Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Logistic Regression** using the classic **Iris Dataset**. Logistic regression is a statistical model used for classification tasks, and the Iris dataset is a popular dataset containing measurements of flowers from three different species.

---

## Dataset Details

The data contain three species of Iris:
- `Iris-setosa`
- `Iris-versicolor`
- `Iris-virginica`

Each sample contains the following features:
1. Sepal Length (cm)
2. Sepal Width (cm)
3. Petal Length (cm)
4. Petal Width (cm)

### Target Variable
The target variable is the species of Iris flower. For binary classification, you can simplify it to distinguish between two species, or for multi-class classification, use all three species.
